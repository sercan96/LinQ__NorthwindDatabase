* If we want to add a colon that does not actually exist in our database, such as total price, and if we want to pull some of the colons we want from the table, we define a class as a view model instead of an anonymous type definition when receiving data with select, and we keep the information in this class. In this way, we can use this data whenever we want.

* In summary, when retrieving data with LINQ queries, view model classes are used to create a custom structure that contains additional data or processed data. This improves code organization and maintainability by separating the different layers of the application.
